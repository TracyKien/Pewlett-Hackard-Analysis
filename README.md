# Overview 
I have been asked by Pewlett-Hackard to help perform an analysis that will determine how many employees will be retiring soon by job title and to determine who would be eligible to participate in mentoring program to help with the 'silver tsunami' as many of the employees are reaching retiring age.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
